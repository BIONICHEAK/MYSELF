A short desc. of AK_AI

Hi all!!!!!!!!!!!

Its me ANANTHAKRISHNAN A.I, wait a minute did u just read A I..... YES!!!!! and did you see my username its BIONICHEAK. You might be wondering whats all about this.... OK... Let's get straight to me myslf. 
I'm a postgraduate in Computational Biology / Bioinformatics and that's why my name sounds like BIONICHEAK, It means someone working on a biological niche and that's me. 
I completed my Bachelor's in Botany and jumped straight to a different world of BIO---INFORMATICS. And as my name suggests i work on AI tooo. Thanks to my parents who named me with an initial - A I , wow... because I'm right now working on that topic and trying to figure out the connection between BIO and computers....
I have been working on building ML based models for different biological predictions.
My masters was focused on building a SVM based ML model for prediction of MoRFs and I did the same from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.
